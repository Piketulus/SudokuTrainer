# Requirement specification

## The purpose of the application

Sudoku Trainer! The application will give users a chance to play/practice sudoku puzzles to improve their solving/thinking skills. 

## Users

To begin with, there will only be the normal users (players), but an admin user could be added later with access and control over parts of the application. 

## Basic functionality

- User can generate a new sudoku puzzle to play
- User can choose between multiple difficulty levels for the puzzle
- User can play the sudoku puzzle
- Completion times are recorded and can be viewed later

## Further development ideas

Beyond the basic version, the application can be expanded (if I have the time) with e.g. the following functionalities:

- Practice mode, where given a new random puzzle, the user has to fill in one number as quickly as possible
  - Completion times stores, average completion time shown
- Can undo actions on the sudoku board
- Completion times are recorded with an inputted signature (name) so users on the same device can differentiate their times.
- Viewing times can be filtered (by name, time, difficulty)
- Double sudoku mode: play two sudoku at once, but both must be played concurrently one input at a time (first put a number into puzzle 1, then have to put a number into puzzle 2 before being able to input into 1 again)
- 4x4, 16x16 sudoku modes
